This is the first-year data science project (Semester 2) for my UPV degree.

It is an interactive Streamlit web application that visualizes various user-selected data features (including gender) across a map of Spain, segmented by Autonomous Communities (Comunidades Autónomas).

The application processes CSV data and uses Python's GeoJSON library for geographic representation.
